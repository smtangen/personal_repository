"related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating",,,,,,

Segment Information,
Reportable Segments,
"We have two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline, which we operate and manage as strategic business units and",
"organize by products and services, and customer groups, respectively. We measure and evaluate our reportable segments",
"based on segment operating income, consistent with the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment",
performance.,
Our segments and their principal activities consist of the following:,
Segment,Description
Wireless,"Wireless’ communications products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are"
,"provided to consumer, business and government customers across the U.S."
Wireline,"Wireline’s voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services include broadband video and data"
,"services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice"
,"services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the U.S., as well as to carriers, businesses and"
,government customers both in the U.S. and around the world.
"During the first quarter of 2017, Verizon reorganized the customer groups within its Wireline segment. Previously, the",
customer groups in the Wireline segment consisted of Mass Markets (which included Consumer Retail and Small Business,
"subgroups), Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale. Pursuant to the reorganization, there are now four customer groups",
"within the Wireline segment: Consumer Markets, which includes the customers previously included in Consumer Retail;",
"Enterprise Solutions, which includes the large business customers, including multinational corporations, and federal",
"government customers previously included in Global Enterprise; Partner Solutions, which includes the customers previously",
"included in Global Wholesale; and Business Markets, a new customer group, which includes U.S.-based small business",
"customers previously included in Mass Markets and U.S.-based medium business customers, state and local government",
customers and educational institutions previously included in Global Enterprise.,
"Corporate and other includes the results of our Media business, branded Oath, our telematics and other businesses,",
"investments in unconsolidated businesses, unallocated corporate expenses, pension and other employee benefit related",
costs and lease financing. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested businesses and other,
adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated in assessing segment performance due to their nature. Although,
"such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings.",
Gains and losses that are not individually significant are included in all segment results as these items are included in the,
chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment performance. We completed our acquisition of Yahoo’s operating,
"business on June 13, 2017.",
"On April 1, 2016, we completed the Access Line Sale. Additionally, on May 1, 2017, we completed the Data Center Sale. See",
Note 2 for additional information. The results of operations for these divestitures and other insignificant transactions are,
included within Corporate and other for all periods presented to reflect comparable segment operating results consistent,
with the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.,
"In addition, Corporate and other includes the results of our telematics businesses for all periods presented, which were",
"reclassified from our Wireline segment effective April 1, 2016. The impact of this reclassification was insignificant to our",
consolidated financial statements and our segment results of operations.,
The reconciliation of segment operating revenues and expenses to consolidated operating revenues and expenses below,
"includes the effects of special items that management does not consider in assessing segment performance, primarily",
because of their nature.,
